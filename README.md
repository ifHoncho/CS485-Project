Employee Performance Evaluation & Appraisal Calculation Using Data Mining
Overview

This project is a proof of concept (PoC) for an Employee Performance Evaluation & Appraisal System utilizing Data Mining techniques, specifically K-means clustering. The system analyzes employee performance data through 360-degree feedback from peers, managers, subordinates, and clients, and automates the appraisal process. The results are visualized through CSV or Excel reports to help managers and HR departments make data-driven decisions.

Features

    360-Degree Feedback: Collect feedback from multiple sources (managers, peers, subordinates, clients).
    K-Means Clustering: Group employees into performance categories (high, medium, low performers) using data mining.
    Performance Evaluation: Automatically compute and generate performance appraisal scores.
    Report Generation: Export appraisal results into CSV/Excel formats for visualization and further analysis.
    Web Interface: A simple, optional web interface for collecting data and visualizing clusters.

System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

    Frontend: Optional web interface for data input, feedback collection, and cluster visualization.
    Backend: Processes employee data, runs K-means clustering, and calculates appraisal scores.
    Database: MySQL stores employee data, performance metrics, feedback, and appraisal results.
    Data Mining Module: Implements K-means clustering for performance analysis.

Infrastructure

    Database: MySQL (hosted locally or on the cloud)
    Compute Server: Python environment (can be hosted on HPC or any cloud provider)
    Web Interface: Flask/Django for the backend with optional frontend features

Technologies Used

    Python: Core programming language for data processing and clustering.
    Flask/Django: Web framework for backend API and data processing.
    Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
    Scikit-learn: Implementing K-means clustering and other machine learning algorithms.
    MySQL: Relational database for storing employee performance and feedback data.
    HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the web-based user interface (optional).
    Google Forms Integration: Option to collect data via forms.

Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.7+: Ensure you have Python installed.
    MySQL: Set up MySQL locally or use a cloud-hosted MySQL database.
    pip: Install dependencies via pip.

Steps

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-performance-appraisal.git
cd employee-performance-appraisal

Install dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up MySQL:

    Create a database for storing employee data.
    Update the database configuration in config.py or .env file.

Run the application:

bash

    python app.py

    Access the Web Interface (if implemented):
        Visit http://localhost:5000 (Flask default) to interact with the application.

Usage
Upload Data (CSV or via Web Interface)

    Upload CSV Data: You can upload CSV files with employee data and feedback to the web interface or directly through the API.
    Run Clustering: The system will preprocess the data, apply the K-means clustering algorithm, and generate performance appraisals.
    Export Reports: Download the final appraisal results in CSV or Excel format.

Sample CSV Structure
Employee_ID	Name	Department	Role	KPI_Score	Peer_Score	Manager_Score	Cluster
001	John Doe	IT	Software Engineer	85	4.5	4.8	High
002	Jane Smith	HR	HR Specialist	78	4.0	4.2	Average
Clustering Output

After processing, employees are grouped into performance categories (high, average, low), and results are made available in the output files.
